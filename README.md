# Pangenome of Teak

Welcome to the repository for my contributions to the **Teak (*Tectona grandis* L.f.) Pangenome** project. Through this work, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in NGS data analysis, structural variation detection, and developing pipelines for genome research.

### **Note:** This repository is currently empty as the project is still in progress. Content will be added once the data and code are cleared for public release.

## About the Project

This project involves the development of a **pangenome for teak**, focusing on:

- **Structural variant identification**
- **Functional annotation** using bioinformatics tools

The broader goal is to enhance our understanding of teak genomic diversity to support:

- **Improved wood quality** and **production**
- **Sustainable forestry practices**
- Genomic tools for **tree breeding**

## Funding and Collaboration

This research is supported by the **INDO-DENMARK JOINT RESEARCH PROJECT**, grant no. **IC-12013(12)/2/2021-EEB-DBT**, funded by the **Department of Biotechnology, Government of India**, under the project titled:

**"Genomic selection for superior heartwood formation in two commercial timber species teak (Tectona grandis) and European oak (Quercus robur) - FastWood"**

## Upcoming Updates

The repository will be updated with scripts, workflows, and results **once internal approvals for sharing are in place**. Stay tuned for further developments!
